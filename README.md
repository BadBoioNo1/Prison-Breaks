# Prison-Breaks  
___
## Dataquest Guided Project!


What i did in this project:

&emsp;- Used data from a real website  
&emsp;- Analized data in Python  
&emsp;- As a sidenote, I learned how to use Jupyter Notebook for a Python project

The project answeres 2 main questions:   
&emsp;1) In which year were there the most attempts to escape out of prison using a helicopter?   
&emsp;2) Which countries have the highest number of attempted jail escapes via helicopter?  

## Results
&emsp;-> The years 1986, 2001, 2007, 2009 are the years with most attempts at a holicopter escape. Each marking a three attempts.  
&emsp;-> France is having the most attempts with almost double the attempts of the second country.
